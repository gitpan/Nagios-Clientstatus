pod2text Nagios::Clientstatus.pm > README

This module is for helping to write new Nagios-servicecheck-programs
without hassle. It's all pure perl, should work everywhere.

You can create it now by using the command shown above from this directory.

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
